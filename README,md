# Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions for simulating the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using the freefem++ software. The simulation includes robust control applications and accuracy testing of the solutions.

## Repository Contents

- `Ks_robust.m`: Implements a robust control approach for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Uses predefined domain parameters and controller settings.

- `Accuray.m`: Calculates the accuracy of the simulated solution against a set of predefined metrics.

- `Accuray_quick.m`: A quicker version of the accuracy calculation script for iterative testing purposes.

- `Accuray_quick_table.m`: Generates a LaTeX table of errors based on the simulation results, facilitating easy documentation and report generation.

- `Ks_robust_stack.m`: A robust stacking method implementation for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky control problem. Includes a comprehensive list of domain parameters and control settings. The script outputs graphical representations of the solution, perturbation, follower, and leader in the domain.

- `Ks_simulation.m`: Conducts a simulation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation based on user-defined parameters.

- `Latex_table_gen.m`: Reads in error data from a text file and generates a LaTeX-formatted table, which can be included in academic papers or reports.
